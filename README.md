Approach:
Project Setup: I initialized the project using React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit. This provided strong type safety and a streamlined way to manage the application state. I used createSlice to handle the user data and filter logic in Redux.

Fetching Users: I utilized the GET /users endpoint from JSONPlaceholder to fetch user data and stored it in the Redux state. This data was displayed in a table with relevant columns like name, username, email, and phone.

Filtering Functionality: I implemented local filtering by adding input fields for each column (name, username, email, phone) and dynamically updating the filtered data as the user typed. The filter logic leveraged Redux to store the current filters and applied the filter dynamically to the user list.

TypeScript for Type Safety: TypeScript was applied throughout the project to ensure strong typing, from defining the shape of the user data to enforcing types for Redux actions and state. This reduced the risk of runtime errors and helped with auto-completion in the IDE.

Styling: I kept the UI minimalistic, using clean and simple styles for the table and inputs, ensuring a user-friendly and functional design.

Challenges:
Complex filtering logic: Creating a dynamic filtering mechanism that updated in real-time for multiple columns required careful handling of state and filtering conditions.
TypeScript with dynamic keys: Ensuring type safety while filtering based on dynamic keys posed a challenge, but TypeScript casting and structured logic helped solve it.

Overall, the approach successfully balanced functionality, type safety, and simplicity.
